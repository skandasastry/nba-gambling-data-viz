# NBA Gambling Project for Database Management
This was a project done for my spring 2020 course Database Management Systems. We took a large dataset containing information 
and statistics from every single NBA game played in the history of the league and all the available recent betting information.
We cleaned the dataset in mySQL (scripts contained in the scripts/ folder) and created a visualization in Tableau.

The visualization can be found here:
